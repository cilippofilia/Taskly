**Swift/SwiftUI**

Core and fundation of the whole app developed and shipped entirly using SwiftUI. 
The whole app is taylored to perfection for every iPhone and 
in order to achive the best user experience possible, and that navite look and feel, I have implemented the following frameworks:

    Used for storing user settings and share it across multiple devices.    

- **Combine**:
    Used to handle asynchronous data and check if the purchase of the full app is still valid.

    Used to keep track of the data the users add and shared it across multiple devices with CloudKit.

    Used to make the search of your projects and tasks from Spotlight and Safari.

    Used to push user-facing notifications when they set reminders of their tasks.

- **XCTests**
    Used to test performance, check if all the conditions are satisfied during code execution and validate user interaction flow.
